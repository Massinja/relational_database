## Objective  
Initially, the task was to write SQL requests to retrieve certain data from the database movies.db. However, description of the tables was not consistent - some field names were inaccurate. Therefore, before approaching the task I decided to collect the data about tables using PRAGMA statements and created Entity Relationship Diagram to see how it all fitted together.
