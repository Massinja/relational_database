## Objective  
Initially, the task was to write SQL requests to retrieve certain data from the database movies.db. However, no description of the tables was given, therefore, before approaching the task I decided to collect some data about tables using PRAGMA statements and created Entity Relationship Diagram to see how it all fitted together.
